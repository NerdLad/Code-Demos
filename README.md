Please read on to see descriptions of the code that I have posted.

# AIPlayer:
Code developed to create an AI controller for a game of checkers. I was given a project with a completely functional game of checkers and was tasked to make a challenging AI opponent for players. To accomplish this, I had to investigate the project and familiarize myself with how the code made the game work and how the human playerâ€™s moves were made. With this knowledge, I made an automation for the AI, and added the minimax algorithm to tell it which move to take. The more moves ahead it looks, the more difficult the AI is. Using this AI script, the client was very happy with the results.

#Tile Spawner
These scripts were developed for a client who wanted procedurally generated tiles to spawn in front of them while vanishing behind them. They wanted the tiles to be randomly spawned by a seed, and other players on the same map through multiplayer would see the same tiles. This was accomplished by using the X and Y coords plus a user designed seed value to pick a specific tile based on the position of the player. 

#Blue Skies
My capstone project for university, Blue skies, features the main character, David, as he fights through hordes of demons that are invading the world and possessing objects.  My main task was to code 3 boss fights that had unique feels and mechanics. The scripts in this folder are for all 3 battles. Check out my portfolio to play the game!

#Polluted Paradise
An educational game of sorts, this game was commissioned from a client working for the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science. She wanted a game to show the detrimental effects of pollution on the environment. My team came up with 3 minigames, a dolphin sorting trash, a turtle swimming home eating jellyfish while avoiding plastic bags, and a crab freeing fish from plastic can holders. My role, among other things, was to code the turtle and crab games to make them fun, challenging, and smooth. Check out my portfolio to play the game!
